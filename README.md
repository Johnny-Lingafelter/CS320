*How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

The best way to ensure that my code is both functional and secure is to test it as thoroughly as I possibly can. While functionality and security are two separate areas, proper testing of my code can ensure that the software exceeds the expected result and also gives me peace of mind that I have created something worthwhile that will not easily or immediately be broken.

*How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpreting user needs comes down to gaining a deep understanding of what the user is hoping to accomplish with the software being written. It is not enough, in my opinion, to simply be handed a document with requirements, but rather see firsthand exactly what the user is expecting when they use the software I am writing. The scrum/agile approach is best for nailing down user requirements and incorporating them into software because development is done in sprints and user/client feedback is constantly incorporated into the development process. In this way I can better interpret the user's needs.

*How do I approach designing software?

I enjoy designing software with a hands-on approach. As I said above, I would much prefer to sit down with the end users of the software I am creating to get a feel for how they will be using the software in the real world, as opposed to being handed a document outlining the software. Documents are most definitely important, but I feel that in tandem with focus groups and face to face meetings they are better utilized. I try to break the user requirements into the smallest pieces and design an architecture of classes around those requirements.
